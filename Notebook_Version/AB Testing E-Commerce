In this project, the company wanted to see if the new pages they developed had a significant effect on users so that the new pages developed could be implemented or it was possible that the new pages developed had no effect on users so they had to keep the old pages. For this reason, the data used had Two groups of equal size were created as the control and treatment groups, labeled A and B. The treatment group (B) was presented with the new web page while the control group (A) was presented with the old one, and the experiment was run.

However, if the p-value ≥ 0.05, we fail to reject H0 and conclude that the data is normally distributed (parametric can be used).\n\n**Variance Homogeneity**\n* H0: The variances between groups are homogeneous (equal).\n* H1: Variances between groups are not homogeneous (different).\n\n*Note:\n* If the data meet the assumption of normality and homogeneous variance, use **T-test**.\n* If the data does not meet the assumption of normality (regardless of homogeneous variance status), use the **Mann-Whitney U test** (non-parametric test).\n* If the data meets the assumption of normality but does not meet homogeneous variance, use **Welch's t-test**.\n\n3. **Analyzing Results and conclusions** \n\nThe hypothesis will be concluded based on the p-value obtained from the parametric/non-parametric test to be performed.
