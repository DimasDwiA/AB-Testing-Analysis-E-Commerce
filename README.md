# A/B Testing Analysis E-Commerce Conversion Rate Analysis
This repository contains an analysis of an A/B test conducted for an e-commerce platform, aimed at improving user conversion rates. The project includes an in-depth analysis of user behavior to determine the impact of various factors on the conversion rate.
## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to evaluate a web page on user conversion rates. An A/B test was conducted in which users were divided into two groups: a control group, which saw the existing website, and a treatment group, which saw the new design. The goal was to determine whether the new web pages resulted in a significant increase in conversion rates.
### Key Steps:
1. Data Exploration: Inspect the dataset for missing values, data types, and overall structure.
2. Statistical Analysis: Apply statistical methods such as hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and power analysis to evaluate the significance of the results.
3. Conclusion: Determine whether the new website layout is significantly better than the existing one based on key metrics.
## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis includes the following key features:

- User ID: Unique identifier for each user.
- Group: Indicates whether the user was in the control group or the treatment group.
- Converted: Indicates whether the user converted (1) or not (0).
## Result
The results obtained fail to reject H<sub>0</sub> or zero hypothesis because the **p-value is more than 0.05** so it can be said that the old page (control group) can still be applied to the website because the new page (treatment group) does not show a significant impact.
